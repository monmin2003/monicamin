                        <h4>I'm Monica.</h4>
						<p>I had never realized that I consumed a love of music. I don't believe that it just came to me– I think that I surrounded myself with it. I fell in love with the idea of simply being able to pour out my feelings, good or bad, and transform it into a melody– a work of art that people could relate to. That's beautiful. <br/>
						<br/>It all started when I was around 7 or 8. I was listening to a Taylor Swift song called "White Horse". I pretended to know the words to the song while 'playing guitar' on a curling iron! Fast forward a few years later, where I was listening to radios and hearing songs every now and then, there was never a song that struck accord to me, or maybe I was too young to acknowledge those lyrics. In 2013, I went to my very first concert on August 23, 2013– The RED Tour, performed by Taylor Swift. I danced along with my friend, eating popcorn while smiling. I loved how Taylor could tell a story through a song and her dancers. It was absolutely breathtaking. I think that's where my whole view on music changed. <br/>
						<br/>On Christmas Day, 2012, I received my very first guitar when I was 9. It was from First Act Discovery, and I have to admit– it wasn't the best guitar. I played my guitar so much that day with my sister, singing 'Call Me Maybe' or other original songs that we made up as we sang. I tried to learn some of the chords that were given to me, but my fingers were too small to be able to play. I put the guitar down for a few years, slowly fading away. <br/>
						<br/>Fast forward a couple years later, I finally purchased my very first Yamaha guitar (that sounded pretty decent!) in the summer of 2015 after getting a few guitar lessons, wanting to pursue a music career.</br>
						<br/>I couldn't find myself committing to the guitar lessons, so I stopped after about a year. I still played the guitar, but had a better time while doing it. On September 4, 2016, I attended my first voice lesson. My teacher was named <a href="http://www.laurajeanandersonmusic.com/">Laura Jean Anderson.</a> She is such a lovely young woman with a timeless soul who creates timeless music. She is still to this day, one of my musical inspirations and heroes. The way she sang and wrote always puts me in awe. When I first stepped into the room, we did a warmup, and she <i>wanted</i> to get to know me. I came every week, giving it my all, and she made me feel comfortable, which I think is very different from other teachers. They can make you feel unwanted, useless, or uncomfortable. Sometimes they might not even motivate you. But even after almost a whole year of working with Laura, she continues to stay grounded and posess all of these qualities.<br/>
						<br/>On October 28, 2016, I wrote my very first song– well, at least the gist of it. I had the <i>biggest</i> crush on a guy named Wilder. I daydreamed about him, even though he never looked my way or said "hi". When my grade and I went to Washington D.C. for a trip, I always saw him with one of my friends. She had told me a few days later that they were both dating. When I had heard the news, I was devestated. I think I even almost cried. On the plane ride home, I wrote a song about the whole situation, while I was still feeling all of these different emotions, not being able to tell how I felt. It was called 'Wildfire'. After that, it ignited a new emotion I had never felt before. It was the satifaction of being able to write how I felt, and giving it a melody that I loved; it was my safe place. So, I started writing more and more songs, about whatever topic I was feeling, whether it was about planets, love, movies, friends... I could write about <i>anything.</i> <br/>
						<br/>During the last months of 2016 and early months of 2017, I went through a dark time. I couldn't find what I wanted in music. I hated the music I was writing, so I stopped. I pushed myself, harder and harder, which I think broke me. I couldn't take it anymore. However, I kept on writing. I wrote a few songs during that time that have stuck with me ever since, such as 'Barely Breathe' and '14'. I don't know how I got out of that dark time in my life, but I know that it was me pushing and telling myself "You can <i>do</i> this. You can. Just believe". So, I guess I did.  <br/>
						<br/>My sister, Jacqueline, has been a huge part of my journey that is still continuing. I can confide in her with absolutely anything, and I know that she will be the person to bring me back up. She's like 'the motivater', only the 'the motivater' is such a monotonous name. Jacqueline, if you're reading this, thank you, thank you, <i>thank you</i>, for always being there for me. :)
						<br/>I feel that love is such a powerful thing. As much as we need it, it can sometimes kills us, whether if we love someone so much, feel empty, or can't even look at your partner sitting across from you. I haven't found love, yet I know so much about it. I see it everywhere I go. Couples giving each other kisses, grandparents holding hands and smiling, or a family taking a photo. It's something that we can't live without. It's what makes us human. Even if we really want to, we can't immediately cut off our love towards someone. That's true love. And if it's true love, it will drive you crazy. </p>
