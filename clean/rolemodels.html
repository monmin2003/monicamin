                <p>I think that role models are such a crucial part of our lives. They are the people that we aspire to be, but become a totally different version of 'awesome'. For me, they are my motivation. If you look at where they started to where they are now, they are in two entirely different places. You have to start somewhere...</p><br/>
                <h4>Ed Sheeran</h4>
                <p>Ed is, in general, a unique person. His music captures the listener's attention, engaging them through his words by telling a story. It's a work of art. All he needs on stage to put on an impeccable performcace is a guitar. It solidifies his guitar and vocal capabilites, which I think, is rare.</p>
                <br/><h4>Kelsea Ballerini</h4>
                <p>Ever heard of a country angel? That's Kelsea. Her voice has the ability to melt into any song, sounding as if it belonged there. <br/>Kelsea writes her music from her heart. She touches on topics from what she's experienced, which makes others relate to her music and go to it for comfort.</p><br/>
                <h4>Shawn Mendes</h4>
                <p>Shawn– where do I begin? He has the voice of something you've never heard before. It's beautiful. I can't even fathom of how strong his voice is, and how he will go out of his way to make sure the fans experience an amazing show. It's difficult to explain how hard-working this young man is, and all of the success he deserves.<br/>p.s. Happy 19th birthday ;)</p> <br/>
                <h4>Sabrina Carpenter</h4>
                <p>Last, but certainly not least, the astonishing Sabrina Carpenter. Words can't even explain how much success and raw talent this young woman has acheived. From being signed at the age of twelve to selling out her first headline tour, Sabrina has it all. She <i>knows</i> how to put on a breathtaking performance, from her voice, songs, and outfits. She can 'take on the world'.</p><br/>
                <p>Nonetheless, all four of these musicians have the instrumental, performing, writing, and vocal capabilities, even though they are all so different but the same. Having a role model can change your outlook on life based on what you and your role model have went through. </p><br/>
